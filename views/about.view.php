            <p class="transition"> <span class="tab">This</span> service was born out of a need for inspiration, motivation, and accountability. Not just for myself,
                but for the community around me. There are many stories that want and need to be shared and I want to do
                my part in helping them get written.
                <br>
                <span class="tab">I</span> have a masterâ€™s degree in communication with a focus on professional writing. I worked as an adjunct
                professor teaching college writing for a local university. When time allows, I share my musings about
                life on my blog (tatertotsanddonuts.wordpress.com). I work part time as a personal trainer at Zoo City
                Fitness and Personal Training.
                <br>
                <span class="tab">I</span> currently offer tutoring services to students of all ages as well as student athletes. I also edit and
                proofread any and all types of writing. I can also help you get your story from your head and heart to
                the paper. Whether you need motivation, inspiration, or the grammar and mechanics of it.
